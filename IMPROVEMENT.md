# Ideas for improvements



1) Subfuction "Choix_Materiaux.m" is located in the folder AND in the UI app.

- Need to check which ine is called and delete the other one (maybe keep the separated sub-function?).



2) Add the field simutalion

- Spot is created in the UI app and function is ready : need to put them together.



3) Add sphero√Øds calculation

- Spot is created in the UI app : need to create the function.


4) Add README.md in the app using the drop down menu
